		<h1>The ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. </h1>
		<h1>It has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great proficiency. </h1>
		<h1>Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. </h1>
		<h1>On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.
</h1>
		<h1>The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). </h1>
		<h1>Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. </h1>
		<h1>Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</h1>
